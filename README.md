# Passthrough-Calculator

The script enables the user to calculate quickly the pass-through and the price reduction (in means) of the fuel price discount in Germany given the estimated price effect.

Note that the application is highly restricted to the setting at hand but the idea and functionalities are applicable to other settings as well.

The application relies solely on Tkinter.

## Features

- Type in the estimated price effect
- Choose between fuel types (Diesel and E10)
- Error handling (like wrong input type or none input)
- Reset with button click
